# Questions
Q1: Has the crime decreased or increased over the last 20 years?
A1: The crime has decreased, though I couldn't get my code to output the answer so I left it out.

Q2: Has the type of crime changed?
A2: If we take a look at our plot, we can see that Larceny is by far the most commited crime from 1994 through 2013, which indicates that the type of crime haven't been changed. 

Q5: Which year was the most crime and what crime occured most times?
Again we can conclude from the plot as well as the numbers, that the year with most crimes commited was 1994 with the type "Larceny/Property/Burglary"
